Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 3:

Commenting out 'linenum =0' will lead to this error:
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined
because linenum variable on line 38 is not defined

If 'gc_count = 0' is commented out, reference to gc_count
on line 64 will generate the same undefined error

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

G-content: 0.21269891276127206
C-content: 0.21790095785011046
A-content: 0.28543651609194487
T-content: 0.28396361329667263

Problem 6:

I got it wrong the first two times.

There are data points of 'I' or 'N' that are included in
'total_count' in all files except test-small.fastq,
which explains the difference between 'sum of C/G/A/T count'
and 'total_count'

Then I needed to exclude the noise.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 8:

Moderate GC-content

Collaboration:

I worked on the problems by myself.

Reflection:

Data analysis is 'garbage-in, garbage-out'.
Scrub the data first.

Also, review logic and update comment in code revision.
